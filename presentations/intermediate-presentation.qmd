## Introduction

- **Objective**: Analyze the causal impact of coaching changes on team performance during the 2023-2024 Premier League season.
- **Approach**: Use match outcomes, coaching history, and techniques learned in class to infer causality.

---

## Background Info

Why this project?  
- Coaching changes are common in football, often seen as a way to improve performance.  
- However, does replacing a coach actually improve results?  
- I want to explore if mid-season coaching changes impact match performance or if other factors (e.g., squad quality) are more influential.

---

## The Research Question

- Do mid-season coaching changes improve team performance?
- Are coaching changes a reactive measure to underperformance or a strategic performance booster?
- What role do team strength and opponent strength play?
- Does the timing of a coaching change (before, mid, or late season) matter?

---

## Data Source Brainstorm

- **Match Outcomes**: Dates, results, goals scored, match location.
- **Coaching Changes**: Coaching transitions across the season.
- **Additional Factors**:
  - **Team Strength**: Squad market value (proxy for team quality).
  - **Opponent Strength**: Opposing team's squad value.
  - **Match Context**: Home vs. away games and timing relative to the coaching change.

## Identification Strategy

- **Outcome Variable**: Points (3 for a win, 1 for a draw, 0 for a loss)
- **Key Adjustment Variables**:
  - Team_Strength (Squad value)
  - Opponent_Strength (Strength of opposing team)
  - Match_Location (Home vs. away)
- **Exclusions**: Start_Date, End_Date, HomeTeam, AwayTeam

---

## Identification Strategy expanded

- **Causal Pathway**:
  - The main assumption is that coaching changes affect team performance through Team Strength.
  - Opponent Strength is included because stronger opponents lower the chances of earning points.
  - Match Location matters since teams tend to perform better at home.

---

- **Why Not Control for Everything?**
  - Start_Date & End_Date are treatment variables that define when a coaching change happens—conditioning on them would introduce bias.
  - HomeTeam & AwayTeam are unnecessary since Team Strength already accounts for team quality.

---

- **Backdoor Criterion Satisfied**:
  - By adjusting for Team_Strength, Opponent_Strength, and Match_Location, we block confounding paths and isolate the causal effect of CoachChange on Points.

## Outcome

- The simulation was designed based on real-world causal assumptions.  
- CoachChange → Team_Strength → Points: We assumed coaching changes influence team performance through squad strength.  
- Opponent Strength & Match Location: Added as key controls since stronger opponents and home advantage affect outcomes.  

---

- Observations:
  - The CoachChange coefficient was underestimated, meaning its impact is likely absorbed by Team_Strength.
  - Team_Strength and Opponent_Strength had the most predictive power.

## EDA

## Outcome

- Team Strength correlates with better performance, while stronger opponents reduce expected points.
- Coaching changes appear to be more reactive than proactive, with mid-season changes associated with lower median points.
- Points distribution aligns with expected league behavior (3 for win, 1 for draw, 0 for loss).
- Few teams change coaches mid-season, making it difficult to isolate effects without deeper analysis.

## Next Steps

- **Review data set** and possibly adjust the columns I added. I am a bit unsure if that's how I want to measure them.  
- **Estimate causal effect** using our example from Monday's class.
