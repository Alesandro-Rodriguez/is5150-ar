## Description

This project aims to analyze the causal impact of coaching changes on team performances during the 2023-2024 Premier League Season. Using a dataset of match outcomes and coaching history, the analysis leverages regression techniques to infer causality.

---

## The Story

This project investigates the impact of mid-season head coaching changes on team performance in the 2023–2024 Premier League season. Coaching changes are often made in response to underperformance, but it’s unclear whether they lead to measurable improvements in outcomes like win percentage or league ranking.

The goal of this project is to analyze whether coaching changes improve team performance and evaluate the extent of their impact. The findings will provide insights into whether these changes justify their cost and strategic importance.

---

## Ideal Dataset

The analysis uses the following data:

1. **Match Outcomes**: Match dates, results, scores, and home/away teams.
2. **Coaching Changes**: A table of head coaching changes with start and end dates.
3. **Additional Variables**:
   - **Team Strength**: Metrics like squad value or past performance.
   - **Opponent Strength**: League ranking or historical performance of opposing teams.
   - **Match Context**: Home vs. away games and timing relative to the coaching change.

---

## Factors Affecting Outcomes

Performance is influenced by several factors:

- **Strategic Leadership**: New coaches may bring different tactics or motivational strategies.
- **Team Dynamics**: Changes may disrupt or improve the team’s cohesion.
- **Timing**: Early-season changes allow time for recovery, while late-season changes are often last-resort measures.
- **Player Quality**: The adaptability and skill of the players affects results.
- **Opponent Strength**: Performance depends on the difficulty of the opposing teams.

---

## Addressing Feedback

- **What do you mean by coaching changes?**  
  Coaching changes refer to replacements of head coaches during the season. This analysis focuses only on head coaching changes for clarity and feasibility.

- **How often do coaching changes occur during a season?**  
  In the 2023–2024 Premier League season, there were approximately 7–10 mid-season head coaching changes.

- **What’s the business angle?**  
  Coaching changes impact financial metrics like sponsorships, ticket sales, and avoiding relegation, which has major monetary implications.

- **Have you found relevant data?**  
  Yes, the analysis uses a Kaggle dataset for 2023–2024 Premier League matches, supplemented with coaching change data manually compiled from public records.

- **What would the outcome be?**  
  Key outcomes include:
  - **Win Percentage**: Improvement in match win rates after a coaching change.
  - **Goal Differential**: Changes in scoring and defensive performance.
  - **League Ranking**: Shifts in table position after coaching changes.

- **Other Variables to Include?**  
  - Team and opponent strength.
  - Match location (home vs. away).
  - Timing of coaching changes (early vs. late season).

---

## Theory

Coaching changes are typically a response to poor results. This project examines whether these changes improve team performance or if outcomes are primarily driven by other factors, such as team quality or opponent difficulty. By controlling for these variables, the analysis aims to estimate the true impact of coaching changes.

## Identification Strategy

### Where We Started
The objective of this project is to analyze the causal impact of coaching changes on team performance in the Premier League, using **Points** as the outcome variable. Points are calculated as **3 for a win, 1 for a draw, and 0 for a loss**. Our initial focus was on identifying key variables and their relationships, as represented in the DAG, to develop a strategy for isolating the causal effect of coaching changes.

### Where We Are Going
The goal of this milestone is to specify an identification strategy that ensures:

- Key confounding variables are included to satisfy the **backdoor criterion**
- Irrelevant variables are excluded to streamline the model
- Decisions are based on sound **causal assumptions** supported by the DAG

### Variables to Include Based on the DAG
- **Date**: Controls for temporal trends and seasonality, such as early-season vs. late-season effects, which may influence both coaching changes and performance
- **Venue**: Captures whether the match was played at home or away, which is a key contextual factor that affects both coaching decisions and outcomes

### Variables to Exclude Based on the DAG
- **Team Strength**: A mediator through which coaching changes influence performance. Conditioning on it would block part of the causal pathway
- **Opponent Strength**: Also influenced by team dynamics and may serve as a mediator; excluding it preserves the total effect
- **Start_Date and End_Date**: These are part of the treatment definition (used to determine when coaching changes occur) and should not be conditioned on directly
- **HomeTeam and AwayTeam**: Team identity is indirectly captured by **Team Strength**
- **Points**: As the outcome variable, it should not be conditioned on

- The **points distribution** confirms the expected trimodal pattern (0, 1, and 3 points), aligning with the Premier League point system where a win earns 3 points, a draw earns 1, and a loss earns 0. The data shows an even spread of wins and losses, with fewer draws.

- **Team strength and opponent strength distributions** reveal a right-skewed pattern. A few teams have extremely high squad values, while most are clustered in a mid-range. This supports using market value as a proxy for team quality, but also hints at inequality in team resources.

- The **average points by venue** chart confirms home-field advantage: teams playing at home earn more points on average (around 1.6) compared to when they play away (around 1.2). This justifies including venue as a confounding variable in the causal model.

- The **correlation heatmap** shows a modest positive relationship between team strength and points (~0.20), and a negative one between opponent strength and points (~-0.28). Coaching changes show a weaker negative correlation with points (~-0.10), suggesting limited direct influence.

- The **distribution of coaching changes** shows that most matches were played without a recent coaching change (~500 games), while fewer (~260) had a coaching change beforehand. This reflects how coaching changes are relatively infrequent but not rare in the dataset.

- The **average points by change timing** bar chart suggests that **mid-season coaching changes are associated with the lowest average points**, supporting the idea that they may be reactive (in response to poor form) rather than transformative. Teams that changed coaches before or late in the season performed similarly to teams that didn’t change coaches.

- **Overall**, the data supports the idea that team strength and opponent difficulty are stronger performance drivers than coaching changes. Coaching switches appear more reactive than strategic.

## Conjoint Analysis

As a supplemental milestone, I conducted a conjoint analysis survey to explore how people prioritize different soccer team management strategies. The goal was to better understand how strategic decisions—such as how a team is built, trained, and managed—shape perceptions of team performance. This ties back to the larger theme of evaluating interventions in soccer, with coaching changes being one example.

The survey asked respondents to choose between hypothetical team profiles. Each profile varied along five key attributes: squad selection strategy, training approach, match strategy, use of technology, and player conditioning.

### Attribute importance

Squad selection was the most influential attribute in respondents’ choices, accounting for over 40% of decision weight. Match strategy was next, followed by tech usage and training approach. Player conditioning was considered the least important.

![](../figures/CBC1 - Attribute importance Chart.png){fig-align="center"}

### Squad selection

Data-driven scouting was the most preferred option by a wide margin. Youth academy focus and superstar transfers were also viewed positively, while fan-voted player signings were rated the least effective.

![](../figures/CBC1 - Squad Selection Chart.png){fig-align="center"}

### Training approach

Respondents favored high-intensity workloads. Rest and recovery-focused approaches received negative scores, suggesting performance was prioritized over recovery. Traditional and AI-optimized training had little effect either way.

![](../figures/CBC1 - Training Approach Chart.png){fig-align="center"}

### Match strategy

Possession-based play was the top tactical preference. High-press strategies were somewhat favored, while counter-attacks and defensive-focused play (park-the-bus) were seen as undesirable.

### Tech usage

Real-time opponent analysis had the highest score. Wearable performance tracking also scored positively. On the other hand, AI-powered substitutions were rated very negatively, suggesting skepticism toward automation in in-game decisions.

![](../figures/CBC1 - Tech Usage Chart.png){fig-align="center"}

### Player conditioning

The most preferred approaches were self-regulated by players and year-round intensive training. Recovery-first and strict rotation systems scored negatively, further indicating a leaning toward performance over rest.

### Summary

This analysis provides an early look at how different types of team management decisions are perceived. While coaching changes are the focal point of the main project, this exercise highlights that how a team is built and managed—particularly in terms of squad strategy and tactics—carries significant weight in how people judge potential performance. It also shows hesitation around relying too heavily on automation and AI in match-day decisions.

## Difference-in-Differences Consideration

One method I considered for estimating the impact of coaching changes was the difference-in-differences (DiD) strategy. This approach compares changes in outcomes for a treatment group (teams with a coaching change) and a control group (teams without a change) over time. The goal is to isolate the effect of the intervention by observing how the two groups evolve from a shared baseline to a shared post-treatment period.

In the context of the Premier League, however, DiD presents some limitations. Matches occur on different days and coaching changes happen at various points in the season. As a result, there is no uniform pre- and post-period that applies to all teams. This violates one of DiD’s core requirements: a clearly defined and consistent treatment time. Additionally, the parallel trends assumption—expecting both groups to follow similar trajectories in the absence of treatment—is unlikely to hold given the competitive structure and variability in matchups across the season.

### Summary

While DiD is commonly used in policy and economics studies, I don't think this aligns well with this project. The variation in timing and complexity of scheduling in professional soccer introduces challenges that make this approach less suitable.
